impress.js
============

It's a presentation framework based on the power of CSS3 transforms and 
transitions in modern browsers and inspired by the idea behind prezi.com.


BROWSER SUPPORT
-----------------

Impress.js is developed with current webkit-based browsers in mind (Chrome,
Safari), but *should* work also in other browsers supporting CSS3 transforms
and transitions (Firefox, IE10).

It's actively developed with newest Chromium and tested in Firefox Aurora.

I don't really expect it to run smoothly in non-webkit-based browser.
If it does, just let me know, I'll glad to hear that!
